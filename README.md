# My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website, please go here [mark-h-daniel.com](https://mark-h-daniel.com) to see the current build, that is hosted on Netlify. 

The website has a welcome section, portfolio, experience and contact sections. It was built using React.js, Material UI frameworks. I have .gitignored a few stylesheets and components if you think something is missing. 

## Acknowledgements
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run Locally

`git clone` this directory, and then in a terminal run
`npm install`
`npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
